"# Movie-Manager---DOM-Fundamentals-Project" 

Project Overview:
This Movie Manager project is a practical implementation focusing on DOM fundamentals for creating dynamic and interactive web application. It's designed to showcase essential DOM manipulation techniques and the usage of various DOM methods extensively .

Features:
*Add Movies: Users can add movies to the application by providing the movie name, image address, and rating.

*Display and Manipulate Elements: Utilizes DOM traversal methods like querySelectorAll, getElementById, and others to select and manipulate elements, displaying them as a NodeList.

*Array Manipulation: Stores movie data in an array data structure, allowing easy manipulation and management of movie information.

*Dynamic Styling and Interaction: Demonstrates changing styles, assigning classes, and altering HTML structure based on user interactions.

*Node Types Exploration: Explores different node types within the DOM document.

*Event Handling: Handles events efficiently using query and traversal methods, enabling responsive user interactions.

*DOM Query Methods: Utilizes querySelector, getElementById, and other methods to select elements and modify their properties.

*Node Traversal: Demonstrates traversal methods like parentNode, children, and querySelectorAll to navigate through the DOM tree for targeted element manipulation.

*Manipulating HTML Structure: Adds, removes, and modifies elements within the movie array and dynamically updates the UI accordingly.
*Interactive Interface: Creates a responsive interface allowing users to interactively add movies and modify their details.
